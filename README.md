# BookSky-Project

Booksky is a minimal book management web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to view a list of books, including title, author, and description, with a button to delete each entry. Users can add new books via a popup form that appears when clicking the "Add" button. This project is designed to be a straightforward example of dynamic content manipulation and form handling with JavaScript, styled for a clean, modern look using CSS and Google Fonts. This project could be a useful starting point for anyone learning frontend development or building small web applications.
